# recommendation_system

![Add to Cart](recommendation_image.jpg)

This project implements a Recommendation System designed to suggest items to users based on their preferences and behavior. It is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Implementation of recommendation algorithms

- Evaluation of model performance

- Visualization of results

Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation

Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the notebook and run step by step:

jupyter notebook "Recommendation System.ipynb"


Follow the instructions inside the notebook to reproduce the results.
